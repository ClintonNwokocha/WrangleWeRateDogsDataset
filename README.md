# We-Rate-Dogs
## Project from Udacity Nano Degree program to wrangle and analyze data

# Description
> This project involved gathering data from three sources;
>1. A server: I needed to download the image prediction dataset that contains information about the dog breeds programmatically
>2. Twitter API: I queried the twitter api using tweepy and scraped data that contains the ratings and basic information about the dogs
>3. Twitter Archived dataset : I manually downloaded this from a link provided to me for the project.

>The goal of this was to wrangle the datasets, going through all tidiness and quality issues, fixing them appropraitely with regards industry standards and make it ready for exploration, analysis and visualizations.

> In addition for exploration purposes, visualizations were made to draw insights from the already cleaned dataset.
